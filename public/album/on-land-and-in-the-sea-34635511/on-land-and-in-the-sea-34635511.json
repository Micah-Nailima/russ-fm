      "biography": "Cardiacs are an English band formed in 1977 and led by Tim Smith. Noted for their complex, varied and intense compositional style and for their eccentric, theatrical stage shows, they have been hailed as an influence by many newer groups and artists.  Their music combines the excitement and energy of punk with the intricacies and technical cleverness of early British progressive rock, a combination sometimes referred to as pronk, although frontman Tim Smith has disavowed this classification.  Cardiacs have released eight studio albums plus a number of live albums, compilation albums and singles between 1980 and 2007, and are best known for the 1988 minor hit single \"Is This the Life?\" They are also noted for attracting strongly diverse responses: they have remained one of Britain's leading cult rock bands during their four-decade-spanning career, but have also attracted virulent critical attack (including a lengthy editorial ban from the British music magazine New Musical Express).  The band has been on indefinite (and possibly permanent) hiatus following the 2008 hospitalisation of Tim Smith after a heart attack and series of strokes.",

            "content": "On Land and in the Sea is the second studio album by the English rock band Cardiacs. It was recorded and mixed in 1988 at The Slaughterhouse studios in Yorkshire, produced by Cardiacs band leader Tim Smith and engineered by Roger Tebbutt.\n\nThe album is seen by many fans as being the definitive Cardiacs release. It was the last to feature the \"classic\" sextet line-up of the band which had been in place since 1984. Saxophonist and backing singer Sarah Smith left the band shortly before the album was released, and both keyboard player William D. Drake and percussionist Tim Quy would have departed before the release of the next studio album (1992's Heaven Born and Ever Bright).\n\nThe album was less overtly conceptual than its predecessor - 1988's A Little Man and a House and the Whole World Window - lacking that album's more explicit lyrical focus on childhood, warfare, the workplace and the loss of innocence. The album's lyrics also featured a number of cut-and-paste quotes or paraphrases from the work of the nineteenth-century Irish poet George Darley (in the songs \"Arnald\" and \"Mare’s Nest\").\n\nOn Land and in the Sea received some of the best reviews of Cardiacs' career. Noting the band's previous role as \"fruitcake purveyors of irreverent, florid, and pomp-ish pop, both harking back to the early ‘70s and ridiculing that period’s excesses,\" Q's Henry Williams described the album as \"a tour-de-force\" and \"a scary and unanticipated triumph,\" referring to the music's \"manic, cackling pace\" and comparing Cardiacs' work to both The Small Faces and Peter Hamill. In Melody Maker, Andrew Smith described it as the first album to have captured \"the full majesty of their sound\" and dubbed it \"insanely sharp; one continuous, sweeping, collection of sawn-off epic joy... a deeply satisfying album.\" He also noted \"When I listen to The Cardiacs, I hear echoes of Broadway musical – in the unapologetic, audacious breadth and scale of their sound – as well as the inscrutably Germanic qualities of a Brecht or Eisler (both of whom would have loved this album). In fact, The Cardiacs are very Brechtian: they never allow the listener to settle into passive receptivity. What astonished me is the amount of energy they expend. It’s not always very elegant, which is why some people have difficulty with it, I suspect, but in a world run by designers and advertising men, who needs elegance?\"\n\nOn Land and in the Sea was originally issued by Alphabet Business Concern in 1989 on vinyl LP, cassette, and CD. The Dutch record label Torso released the album on CD with the inclusion of five extra tracks. The album was reissued on CD in 1995 (minus the bonus tracks) along with the rest of Cardiacs' back catalogue. After a brief period of unavailability during the mid-2000s, the album was re-pressed in August 2007 and is currently available on the band's official website. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cardiacs/On+Land+and+in+the+Sea\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

# RussFM Home Page Design Plan

## Overview

Create an engaging, modern home page that showcases the collection as a curated experience, moving beyond simple album listings to create a compelling entry point that highlights the wealth of data and beautiful artwork available.

## Current Collection Data Assets

Based on analysis of the collection.json and detailed album data, we have access to:

### Rich Metadata
- **Album Information**: Release dates, genres, artist biographies, Apple Music/Spotify links
- **Temporal Data**: Date added to collection, release years (spanning decades)
- **Multi-service Integration**: Apple Music, Spotify, Wikipedia, Last.fm data
- **High-quality Images**: Hi-res, medium, and avatar/thumbnail versions for albums and artists
- **Genre Taxonomy**: Comprehensive genre tagging across multiple categories

### Collection Analytics Potential
- **Recent additions** with date_added timestamps
- **Genre distribution** across the collection
- **Era/decade analysis** from release years
- **Artist diversity** and collaboration patterns
- **Release timeline** spanning multiple decades

## Design Philosophy Alignment

Following the "Editorial Modern" philosophy from the existing design.md:
- **Content-forward approach**: Artwork as the primary visual element
- **Clarity through contrast**: High-contrast layouts that make content pop
- **Sophisticated interactions**: Meaningful micro-interactions and transitions

## Proposed Home Page Sections

### 1. Hero Section - "Featured Albums"
**Purpose**: Let the music and artwork speak for itself with minimal text

**Design**:
- Large, rotating album artwork showcase (3-4 albums)
- Minimal text overlay - just album/artist names
- Clean, gallery-style presentation
- Subtle auto-rotation with manual navigation controls
- Direct click-through to album details

**Data Source**: 
- Recent additions, high-rated albums, or diverse genre representation
- High-resolution album artwork taking center stage

### 2. "Recently Added" Carousel
**Purpose**: Highlight the living, growing nature of the collection

**Design**:
- Horizontal scrolling carousel of recent additions
- Album covers with overlay showing "Added [timeframe]"
- Click-through to individual album pages
- Smooth horizontal scroll with momentum

**Data Source**: 
- Sort collection by `date_added` field
- Display last 12-15 additions

### 3. "Collection Insights" Bento Grid
**Purpose**: Showcase the depth and diversity of the collection through data visualization

**Design**: 
- Modern Bento Grid layout with varied tile sizes
- Mix of statistics and visual elements:

**Tiles**:
- **Total Albums Count**: Large number with subtle animation
- **Decades Covered**: Visual timeline showing release year distribution
- **Top Genres**: Elegant genre cloud or bar visualization
- **Latest Discovery**: Featured newest addition with details
- **Artist Spotlight**: Rotating artist feature with biography snippet
- **Collection Growth**: Simple graph showing additions over time

### 4. "Explore by Era" Timeline
**Purpose**: Invite exploration of the collection's historical span

**Design**:
- Interactive horizontal timeline
- Decades as clickable segments (1970s, 1980s, etc.)
- Representative album covers for each era
- Smooth hover interactions revealing era details

**Data Source**:
- Group albums by release decade
- Show count per era with sample artwork

### 5. "Genre Journeys" Grid
**Purpose**: Showcase the musical diversity and enable genre-based discovery

**Design**:
- Grid of genre cards with representative artwork collages
- Each card shows genre name, album count, and 3-4 representative covers
- Subtle hover animations
- Links to filtered album views

**Data Source**:
- Group by primary genres
- Select visually appealing albums as representatives

### 6. "Musical Connections" Network
**Purpose**: Highlight interesting relationships and collaborations

**Design**:
- Visual representation of artist collaborations or shared genres
- Interactive network diagram or simpler connected cards
- Focus on multi-artist albums and genre crossovers

**Data Source**:
- Albums with multiple artists
- Cross-genre albums
- Artist collaboration patterns

## Technical Implementation Approach
